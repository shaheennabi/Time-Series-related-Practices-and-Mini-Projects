# Time Series Forecasting Practices and Mini-Projects

Welcome to my **Time Series Forecasting** repository â€” a collection of hands-on experiments and projects using models like **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, **LSTM**, and **GRU**. This space explores the full pipeline: from **data preprocessing** to building and validating forecasting models on real-world datasets such as **stock prices**, **weather data**, and **sales trends**.

##  Key Areas Covered

- **Forecasting Models**: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, LSTM, GRU, AutoARIMA, SARIMA  
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, outliers, and seasonal adjustments  
- **Advanced Techniques**: Ensemble models, hybrid methods, and custom forecasting strategies  
- **Real-World Applications**: Financial, climate, and demand forecasting  

This repository is regularly updated with new techniques and experiments.  
**Contributions and feedback are welcome!**
