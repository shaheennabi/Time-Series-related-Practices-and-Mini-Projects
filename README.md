## Stationarity Tests

### ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)
- Hypothesis Test:
  - **Null (H0)**: Series has a unit root → **Non-stationary**
  - **Alt (H1)**: Series is **stationary**

### KPSS Test (Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin)
- Hypothesis Test:
  - **Null (H0)**: Series is **stationary**
  - **Alt (H1)**: Series is **non-stationary**

### KS 2-Sample Test (Kolmogorov–Smirnov)
- Tests whether two samples (e.g., different time segments) are from the **same distribution**
- Used to **indirectly evaluate strict stationarity**
